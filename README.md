# Building a Nuxt Blog and Portfolio

This a project that I am using to learn Nuxt. I already know how to use VueJS.  
This is me following along [a udemy class](https://www.udemy.com/share/109JCZ3@5Px0wdVcu4_uSlW-eBjvqVXUTuw2iFXPHvujn_29RaBPb6P5FI6TNouoIi2UAx_m/) to learn nuxt.  
Note that this does not exactly follow the class example.  
I add a bit of stuff to learn and what-if a bit on my own.
