# Day 3

# A Blog?

Why am I tracking the days by the day of P90X? Honestly, I couldn't tell you.
Honestly, starting a blog was not in the cards for this year either, but it came
with the Udemy course I'm taking on Nuxt, so I figured I dive in with it too.

Some of you know my deeper history but I'm willing to bet most of you don't.
For the time-being, I am going to keep it that way. While this is a personal
blog with the mundane daily activities of my life documented here, this is more
for me than for you.

If you want to know more, feel free to reach out. If it's too personal, I'll
tell you so.
